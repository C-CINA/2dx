# MANUAL: This script moves all choosen directories into a TRASH subdirectory. Use with extreme caution !!!
#
#$end_local_vars
#
# This defines some variables that we might need:
set proc_2dx = ""
set bin_2dx = ""
set app_2dx_image = ""
#
#$end_vars
#
# This sets the scriptname variable:
set scriptname = 2dx_deleteDir
#
# This removes the old logfile, so that a new fresh one can be created:
\rm -f LOGS/${scriptname}.results
#
# This initializes the CCP4 environment, and other variables.
set ccp4_setup = 'n'
source ${proc_2dx}/initialize
#
# This advances the progress bar to the 1% position:
echo "<<@progress: 1>>"
#
# This creates all needed subdirectories in the current merge directory, in case they are missing:
${proc_2dx}/2dx_makedirs 
#
# This translates the list of directories to work on into one single long line:
cat 2dx_merge_dirfile.dat | tr "\n" " " > SCRATCH/2dx_merge_dirfile_oneline.dat
set dirlist = "`cat SCRATCH/2dx_merge_dirfile_oneline.dat`"
#
# This memorizes the current merge directory under the variable "olddir":
set olddir = $PWD
#
if ( ! -d TRASH ) then
  \mkdir TRASH
endif
#
echo ":: "
#
# This initiates a big "foreach" loop that sets the variable "dirfile" to each of the items in the "dirlist" and runs the contents of the loop with this value:
foreach dirfile ( ${dirlist} ) 
  echo "::Moving into TRASH: ${dirfile}"
  #
  \mv -f ${dirfile} TRASH 
  #
end
#
echo ":: "
echo "::Images are now in ${PWD}/TRASH "
echo ":: "
#
# Move the progress bar to 100%:
echo "<<@progress: 100>>"
#
# Leave a message on the logfile that the script finished:
${proc_2dx}/linblock "${scriptname} finished correctly."
