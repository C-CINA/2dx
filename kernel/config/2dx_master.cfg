# This file represents the data processing database. 
# All processing parameters for individual images are stored in copies of this file. The copies are then called 2dx_image.cfg.
# The merging directory also uses a copy of this file, which is then called 2dx_merge.cfg.
# Upon launching, the program 2dx_image does the following:
# It reads the system-wide root version of this file, usually in /usr/local/2dx/kernel/config/2dx_master.cfg.
# Then it updates all parameters with settings from the personal choice, usually stored in ~/.2dx/2dx_master.cfg.
# Then it updates all parameters with settings from the project wide database, e.g. in ~/MyProjects/ProteinA/2dx_master.cfg.
# Then it updates all parameters with the tilt-angle specific databases, e.g. in ~/MyProjects/ProteinA/PrtA00/2dx_master.cfg.
# Then it updates all parameters with the image-specific values, e.g. in ~/MyProjects/ProteinA/PrtA00/ProtA0012345601/2dx_image.cfg, 
# .... but it ONLY does the latter update, if the parameter "SYNC_WITH_UPPER_LEVEL" is set to "NO".
# This results in the loaded database that 2dx_image keeps in RAM memory, until you press the SAVE icon on that program. 
#
# If you want to process one additional image, it will be initialized with a copy of the 2dx_master.cfg file one level above. You can there define your default starting values for the parameters for these images, e.g. define kV, Cs, defocus, pixel size, etc.. once for the entire processing batch.
#
# If you want to update the database by adding one additional parameter, you should do that on the system-wide file in /usr/local/2dx/kernel/config/2dx_master.cfg. Upon opening 2dx_image and saving the database, you then have added that parameter to your local working file.
#
# The 2dx_merge program does it similary as above:
# It reads the system-wide root version of this file, usually in /opt/local/2dx/kernel/config/2dx_master.cfg.
# Then it updates all parameters with settings from the personal choice, usually stored in ~/.2dx/2dx_master.cfg.
# Then it updates all parameters with settings from the project wide database, e.g. in ~/MyProjects/ProteinA/2dx_master.cfg. (todo: wrong as this file does not exist and is just a link)
# Then it updates all parameters with the merging values, e.g. in ~/MyProjects/ProteinA/merge/2dx_merge.cfg, 
#
# Since Version 3.3, 2dx is initializing a new project with symbolic links in place of the 2dx_master.cfg files in the protein and tilt-angle directories.
# These are e.g. like this:
# In the Project directory  ~/MyProjects/ProteinA/ is a link:    2dx_master.cfg   ->   merge/2dx_merge.cfg
# In the Tilt Angle directories   ~/MyProjects/ProteinA/PrtA00 is a link: 2dx_master.cfg   ->   ../2dx_master.cfg
# In the Tilt Angle directories   ~/MyProjects/ProteinA/PrtA30 is a link: 2dx_master.cfg   ->   ../2dx_master.cfg
# In the Tilt Angle directories   ~/MyProjects/ProteinA/PrtA45 is a link: 2dx_master.cfg   ->   ../2dx_master.cfg
# In the Tilt Angle directories   ~/MyProjects/ProteinA/PrtA60 is a link: 2dx_master.cfg   ->   ../2dx_master.cfg
# ... and so on.
#
# The above link structure makes sure that only one copy of the 2dx_master.cfg database exists, which is the one in the merge directory called 2dx_merge.cfg.
# Project-wide parameters like the Symmetry are then only set once for the entire project, and remain synchronized.
#
# If you want to have a different default setting for one tilt-angle than for another one (e.g. if the 30-tilt images are all at higher defocus), then you can replace the link in the PrtA30 directory above with a local copy of the 2dx_master.cfg file, and update that one to your default settings for that tilt range.
# Instead of working with tilt-range directories, you can also work with session directories, if for example you have two different microscopes that produced images for one processing project. If one worked at 300kV and the other one at 200kV, you could have directories like:
# In the 300kV directories   ~/MyProjects/ProteinA/Mic300
# In the 200kV directories   ~/MyProjects/ProteinA/Mic200
#

# LEGEND: imagesource defines what kind of recording device the image came from. This decides about image-source-specific pre-porocessing of the image: The first option scales the data to floating point variables with an average grey value of zero and a standard deviation of 100. This is optimal for processing. Another interesting setting is "OD for autoscaling to 0...16000", which then has as effect that the images are all scaled to a grey scale range between 0 and 16000, and handled in MODE=1 or INTEGER*2 format. This is the best mode and dynamic range for MRC programs. Another option is "OD autoscaling with signed/unsigned swap", which can be used if your data suffer from an "unsigned/signed integer" bug: If your data are stored as "unsigned integer", they range from 0...65535. If these data are then read by the MRC program tif2mrc as "signed integer", with an expected data range from -32768...32767, then the resulting image has pixels that in a Histogram plot show a split peak at two edges, instead of one centrally located Gaussian peak. You can then use this option with the signed/unsigned swap to correct this problem.

# LEGEND: stepdigitizer is the scanner step size (for film), or the CCD camera's pixel size, or the pixel size on a virtual screen display unit (for STEM images). For a CCD camera, this value is typically 10 to 25 micrometer. For a TEM, the CCD camera can produce images of a different magnification than the screen, due to a so-called post-magnification between screen and CCD. You have to either give the exact CCD camera pixel size, and then specify as "magnification" the real magnification between sample and CCD, including any "post-magnification", or you have to give as "CCD pixel size" a value that takes the post-magnification into account. In this case, give as CCD pixel size the size that would correspond to a CCD pixel on the screen. In micrometer.

# LEGEND: The type of tile-wise CTF correction to be applied. This is done to the input image, before unbending. The image is cut into overlapping tiles, each of which is CTF corrected, and the result placed into the output image. Tiles should be cut sufficiently large (parameter "Outer Tiles", so that during CTF correction the ripples of the larger PSFs can be included in the CTF correction.  CTF correction can be done by phase flipping (leaving amplitudes as they are), or CTF multiplication (putting one additional CTF onto the image, thereby correcting the phases, but making amplitudes even worse), or Wiener filtration (correcting Amps and Phases already here). Recommended is "CTF multiplication", because only this doesn't cause artifacts in the FFT of the corrected image.

For an ALAT of 200A, this should be 0.0025. You can use a larger value for this parameter if you have only non-tilted reference data but want to align tilted image data to your reference. In this case, a larger zstarwin of e.g. 0.1 gives you a larger vertical search range in Fourier space, so that for your tilted data a reference can be found from the non-tilted data. Once you have a 3D Fourier volume as reference available, you can reduce the zstarwin to smaller values, e.g. 0.02 and then 0.01 to allow a finer diversification of lattice line details.
