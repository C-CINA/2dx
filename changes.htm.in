<font color="blue">3.3.0</font> Dec. 24, 2010 <br>
<ul> 
<li> <font color="red">[Bug]</font> 3D reference values from lattice lines are now correctly sorted, so that the creation of synthetic unbending references via MAKETRAN now works.
<li> <font color="red">[Bug]</font> Fixed a bug in synthetic unbending when using TTF. 
<li> Added a script option in 2dx_image for the <I>tilt geometry refinement from defocus gradient</I>. 
<li> 2dx_merge now plots FOM-Symbol plot for non-tilted merged data.
<li> 2dx_merge now creates correct symbolic links for the configuration files 2dx_master.cfg upon initialization of a new project. These links are needed for correct synchronization of global parameters (e.g. synchronization of the crystal symmetry).
<li> Added the configuration file 2dx_merge-user.cfg into the user's home directory/.2dx, which stores user settings for 2dx_merge. It is also used by the file browser to navigate to the last used project directory.
<li> <font color="red">[Bug]</font> 2dx_image becomes now the active window even when its called from 2dx_merge. 
<li> CCP4 can now also be located in /Applications on MAC OS X. 
<li> The local database 2dx_merge.cfg is now updated, when new parameters are added to the master configuration file /usr/local/2dx/kernel/config/2dx_master.cfg. 
<li> Added a new parameter attribute ISWRONG, which when set to YES visualizes the specified values in the GUI in grey. This depicts that these values should be altered before processing. By editing them they become black on white, and ISWRONG is set to NO. This allows to have parameters prefilled with default values that are technically functional, but still wrong. For example, the default setting for defocus is 5000.0, but the exact value still has to determined. The defocus entry of 5000.0 is therefore initially labeled as ISWRONG.
<li> The variable attribute GLOBAL in the CShell scripst has been replaced with DISPLAY to make its functionality more clear. Scripts containing the attribute GLOBAL will still run. 
<li> Updated the merging scripts so that Maximum Likelihood (ML) processing results from 2dx_image can also be used for merging. For this purpose, a new parameter <i>ML_use_for_merging</i> has been introduced, which allows to decide, if a ML result should be used for merging, or if the Unbending result should instead from this image be used for merging.
<li> <font color="red">[Bug]</font> Fixed a bug in the ML code, which resulted in the Amplitude and Phase data to be written out with 180deg phase shift with respect to the Unbending results.
<li> Added a feature that checks if the symmetry parameter setting for ML processing is following the same space group symmetry as otherwise choosen for the project.
<li> <font color="red">[Bug]</font> Fixed a bug in the ML code, which resulted in the Amplitude and Phase data to be written out without the initial image idenfier number. This prevented this file from being able to be included in the merging.
<li> Added a parameter <i>mask_reset_reflocation</I> that allows to decide, if during masking and optionally cropping of the crystal area the reference location should be reset to the new center of the crystal, or if it should remain in the old position.
</ul>

<font color="blue">3.2.0</font> Jun. 6, 2010 <br>
<ul> 
<li> Changed the build system to <a href="http://www.cmake.org">CMake</a>.
<li> Built with  <a href="http://www.trolltech.com">Qt 4.6.2</a>.
<li> Introduced new bug tracker  <a
  href="http://www.2dx.unibas.ch/documentation/2dx-bug-tracker">http://www.2dx.unibas.ch/documentation/2dx-bug-tracker</a>,
  which is also adapted by the bug report function. 
<li> <font color="red">[Bug]</font> Initialization of the full screen
  browser now shows directly the corresponding image.

<font color="blue">3.1.2</font> Nov. 11, 2008 <br>
<ul> 
<li> Further work on 3D merging scripts:
<li> Added <b>automatic refinement of 3D merging switches</b> for <i>REVHK, ROT90, ROT180, SGNXCH, REVHND, REVXSGN</I>, and <i>SIGN-OF-TILTANGLE</I>.
<li> Added Status viewer in HTML format. Users can easily define or modify the content of the Status viewer, by editing the file in  kernel/config/2dx_image/2dx_status.html
<li> Added PLOTRESKA (provided by Anchi Cheng), to display resolution circles in IQ plot, including TAXA for tilted images.
<li> Scripts now report all defined variables automatically to the logfile.
<li> Removed parameter refcenterimage. Reference position now is to be defined directly.
<li> Automatic masking of crystal area in QUADSERCH now uses smooth edges.
<li> <font color="red">[Bug]</font> Fixed major bug in p3 and p6 symmetrization.
<li> Extended all MRC and other programs to become able to open 20,000x20,000 pixel images. The classical full-screen browser in 2dx_image is limited in RAM to 2GB, nevertheless. To display larger images, the experimental full-screen browser needs to be used, for the time being.
<li> <font color="red">[Bug]</font> 2D Maximum Likelihood processing now maintains orientation of the original image, and correctly interprets phase origin information.
</ul>

<ul> 
<li> 3D merging operational.
<li> Script improvements are based on feedback during the EMBO Workshop on Cryo-EM in August 2008 (a big thank-you goes to Vinzenz Unger), and on the Workshop for Electron Crystallography of Membrane Proteins at UC Davis, Sept. 2008.
<li> All processing related elements in 2dx have been separated out into a modular "kernel" which is separately compiled. Should ease minor-upgrades from now on. 
<li> <font color="red">[Bug]</font> Fixed a number of installation/configuration bugs
<li> <font color="red">[Bug]</font> Fixed zoom-window offset problem in certain versions of linux. (Ubunutu,FC5+?) 
<li> Moved CCP4 initialization into proc/initialize. 
<li> <font color="red">[Bug]</font> Fixed bug where 2dx_merge was not searching a user's home directory for configuration files.

<li> Image Preview made more readable.
<li> Fixed long-standing memory leak in mrcImage which caused 1/4-&gt;1/3 of images to remain in memory with each rescale.
<li> Menubar stabilized across platform.
<li> Added script to transform large TIFF images from <i>transmission</i> into <i>OD</i>, then mask the negative text label, and finally crop into sub-images for further processing.
<li> Spot Select Tool in Image Navigator now displays file name. "Useful when processing hundreds of images."
<li> Image Preview now shows header information for <font color="green">.map</font> files.
<li> Added new translator infastructure for results viewing. 
<ul>
<li> Changing the default response to when a user double clicks on a result item (image, log file, etc.) can now be done by adding a {ext}.tr to the new <font color="green">2dx/plugins/translators</font> directory.
<li> This cshell script will be run any time a file with extension {ext} is activated by the user, with the file name passed as an argument to the script.
<li> Additionally, scripts can access all program defaults from <font color="green">~/.2dx/2dx.cfg</font>, and called as <font color="green"> $(application name)_2dx_app</font> exactly as it appears in <font color="green">~/.2dx/2dx.cfg</font>. Example: <font color="green">$webBrowser_2dx_app</font>. 
<li> <font color="green">~/.2dx/2dx.cfg</font> can be edited by the user and new programs may be added for use in plugins.
</ul>
<li> Sequential execution allowing scripts to be repeatedly re-executed added to all scripts. (By default, currently only used in <b>2dx_merge</b>.)

<li> The Maximum Likelihood processing only works on images of non-tilted 2D samples.
</ul>
<BR>
<li> <b>2dx_image</b> Gui-free mode added.

<li> Example: <font color="green">./2dx_image ~/Proteins/Prot-2000 "2dx_initialize,2dx_fftrans,+2dx_evaluateLattice"</font>
<li> Calling from <b>2dx_merge</b> scripts is identical except that by adding '<font color="green">set app_2dx_image=""</font>' to the top of a script will allow the script to be called as:
<li> <font color="green">${app_2dx_image} ${image_directory} "Standard_Scripts,+Custom_Scripts"</font>
</ul>
<li> Added script for unbending with <i>Synthetic Reference</i> from a merged 2D or 3D dataset.
<li> Added script for manual definition of a <font color="green">>phase origin</font> within the final map, via mouse positioning and <font color="green">Shift + "P"</font>. Re-running the script then updates the phase origin and re-calculates the final map.
<li> Approximate real-space lattice is now viewable (with phase origin of 0&deg;) as calculated by current Fourier lattice.
<li> Navigator now has windowed/fullscreen mode. Windowed mode shouldn't dominate focus on linux, allowing the user to shift to other windows of 2dx/other running programs.  
<li> <font color="green">2dx/2dx_image/proc</font> has been moved to <font color="green">2dx/proc</font> and is used by both <b>2dx_image</b> and <b>2dx_merge</b>.

<li> Numerous small graphical fixes.
<li> Certain changes related to text display, ellipsis usage, text wrapping, etc.

Scripts in the processing queue appear highlighted in one color, the currently running script highlighted another
<li> Log viewer no longer wraps long lines
<li> Added "Silent Verbosity" for Log viewer for users on slow systems. (As message passing of script processes can occasionally require noticable system resources)
