2dx : Image processing software for 2D Electron Crystallography

About:
2dx  aims at facilitating computer image processing in electron crystallography. 
It features streamlined processing solutions with optional full automation. 2dx 
is an open source software system, written in C++ and using the Qt libraries. 
2dx is based on the MRC programs, which are distributed in an adapted form 
together with the 2dx installer. The original MRC programs, were written by 
Richard Henderson and others. We have modified or extended some MRC programs 
in order to interface them with the 2dx software environment, and have added 
some additional functions and programs.
